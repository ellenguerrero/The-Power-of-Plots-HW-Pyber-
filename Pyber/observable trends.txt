You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.

1. Urban cities have a higher population of drivers, conversely, rural cities have less drivers. 
As a result, the average fare for rides in rural areas is higher.  

2. Rural cities have less total rides with the highest fares in the data set.  

3. Suburban cities fall between rural and urban when it comes to total drivers, fare, and rides, however, both 
rural and suburban cities combined account for less than 1/4 of the total driver count. Urban cities have higher
population/demand so the fares can remain lower, but still make up the majority.
